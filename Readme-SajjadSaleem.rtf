- I have added a GridManager.cs script in SampleScene.
- There are folders Scripts and prefabs containing scripts that are being used for the Grid generation and prefabs that are being generated on the grid.
- Due to the shortage of time , I was not able to test it and had to submit it urgently , incase of any error or issues please let me know and i'll be able to send the updated version of the code.
- I was only able to add 4 different prefabs with different kind of gems.
Thanks !!
